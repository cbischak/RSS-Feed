RSS Proof of Concept

This flask frame work and associated bootstrap files will create and run a small, demonstration website locally that uses feedparser 
to create a parsed RSS reddit news feed and a parsed Atom feed. Must have feedparser installed locally. Simply use python run.py to start. The feed is currently badly styled.
